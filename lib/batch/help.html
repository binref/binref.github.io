class CALL:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Calls one batch program from another.

    CALL [drive:][path]filename [batch-parameters]

      batch-parameters   Specifies any command-line information required by the
                         batch program.

    If Command Extensions are enabled CALL changes as follows:

    CALL command now accepts labels as the target of the CALL.  The syntax
    is:

        CALL :label arguments

    A new batch file context is created with the specified arguments and
    control is passed to the statement after the label specified.  You must
    &#34;exit&#34; twice by reaching the end of the batch script file twice.  The
    first time you read the end, control will return to just after the CALL
    statement.  The second time will exit the batch script.  Type GOTO /?
    for a description of the GOTO :EOF extension that will allow you to
    &#34;return&#34; from a batch script.

    In addition, expansion of batch script argument references (%0, %1,
    etc.) have been changed as follows:


        %* in a batch script refers to all the arguments (e.g. %1 %2 %3
            %4 %5 ...)

        Substitution of batch parameters (%n) has been enhanced.  You can
        now use the following optional syntax:

            %~1         - expands %1 removing any surrounding quotes (&#34;)
            %~f1        - expands %1 to a fully qualified path name
            %~d1        - expands %1 to a drive letter only
            %~p1        - expands %1 to a path only
            %~n1        - expands %1 to a file name only
            %~x1        - expands %1 to a file extension only
            %~s1        - expanded path contains short names only
            %~a1        - expands %1 to file attributes
            %~t1        - expands %1 to date/time of file
            %~z1        - expands %1 to size of file
            %~$PATH:1   - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                           environment variable and expands %1 to the fully
                           qualified name of the first one found.  If the
                           environment variable name is not defined or the
                           file is not found by the search, then this
                           modifier expands to the empty string

        The modifiers can be combined to get compound results:

            %~dp1       - expands %1 to a drive letter and path only
            %~nx1       - expands %1 to a file name and extension only
            %~dp$PATH:1 - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                           environment variable for %1 and expands to the
                           drive letter and path of the first one found.
            %~ftza1     - expands %1 to a DIR like output line

        In the above examples %1 and PATH can be replaced by other
        valid values.  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid argument
        number.  The %~ modifiers may not be used with %*
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class SET:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Displays, sets, or removes cmd.exe environment variables.

    SET [variable=[string]]

      variable  Specifies the environment-variable name.
      string    Specifies a series of characters to assign to the variable.

    Type SET without parameters to display the current environment variables.

    If Command Extensions are enabled SET changes as follows:

    SET command invoked with just a variable name, no equal sign or value
    will display the value of all variables whose prefix matches the name
    given to the SET command.  For example:

        SET P

    would display all variables that begin with the letter &#39;P&#39;

    SET command will set the ERRORLEVEL to 1 if the variable name is not
    found in the current environment.

    SET command will not allow an equal sign to be part of the name of
    a variable.

    Two new switches have been added to the SET command:

        SET /A expression
        SET /P variable=[promptString]

    The /A switch specifies that the string to the right of the equal sign
    is a numerical expression that is evaluated.  The expression evaluator
    is pretty simple and supports the following operations, in decreasing
    order of precedence:

        ()                  - grouping
        ! ~ -               - unary operators
        * / %               - arithmetic operators
        + -                 - arithmetic operators
        &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;               - logical shift
        &amp;                   - bitwise and
        ^                   - bitwise exclusive or
        |                   - bitwise or
        = *= /= %= += -=    - assignment
          &amp;= ^= |= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;=
        ,                   - expression separator

    If you use any of the logical or modulus operators, you will need to
    enclose the expression string in quotes.  Any non-numeric strings in the
    expression are treated as environment variable names whose values are
    converted to numbers before using them.  If an environment variable name
    is specified but is not defined in the current environment, then a value
    of zero is used.  This allows you to do arithmetic with environment
    variable values without having to type all those % signs to get their
    values.  If SET /A is executed from the command line outside of a
    command script, then it displays the final value of the expression.  The
    assignment operator requires an environment variable name to the left of
    the assignment operator.  Numeric values are decimal numbers, unless
    prefixed by 0x for hexadecimal numbers, and 0 for octal numbers.
    So 0x12 is the same as 18 is the same as 022. Please note that the octal
    notation can be confusing: 08 and 09 are not valid numbers because 8 and
    9 are not valid octal digits.

    The /P switch allows you to set the value of a variable to a line of input
    entered by the user.  Displays the specified promptString before reading
    the line of input.  The promptString can be empty.

    Environment variable substitution has been enhanced as follows:

        %PATH:str1=str2%

    would expand the PATH environment variable, substituting each occurrence
    of &#34;str1&#34; in the expanded result with &#34;str2&#34;.  &#34;str2&#34; can be the empty
    string to effectively delete all occurrences of &#34;str1&#34; from the expanded
    output.  &#34;str1&#34; can begin with an asterisk, in which case it will match
    everything from the beginning of the expanded output to the first
    occurrence of the remaining portion of str1.

    May also specify substrings for an expansion.

        %PATH:~10,5%

    would expand the PATH environment variable, and then use only the 5
    characters that begin at the 11th (offset 10) character of the expanded
    result.  If the length is not specified, then it defaults to the
    remainder of the variable value.  If either number (offset or length) is
    negative, then the number used is the length of the environment variable
    value added to the offset or length specified.

        %PATH:~-10%

    would extract the last 10 characters of the PATH variable.

        %PATH:~0,-2%

    would extract all but the last 2 characters of the PATH variable.

    Finally, support for delayed environment variable expansion has been
    added.  This support is always disabled by default, but may be
    enabled/disabled via the /V command line switch to CMD.EXE.  See CMD /?

    Delayed environment variable expansion is useful for getting around
    the limitations of the current expansion which happens when a line
    of text is read, not when it is executed.  The following example
    demonstrates the problem with immediate variable expansion:

        set VAR=before
        if &#34;%VAR%&#34; == &#34;before&#34; (
            set VAR=after
            if &#34;%VAR%&#34; == &#34;after&#34; @echo If you see this, it worked
        )

    would never display the message, since the %VAR% in BOTH IF statements
    is substituted when the first IF statement is read, since it logically
    includes the body of the IF, which is a compound statement.  So the
    IF inside the compound statement is really comparing &#34;before&#34; with
    &#34;after&#34; which will never be equal.  Similarly, the following example
    will not work as expected:

        set LIST=
        for %i in (*) do set LIST=%LIST% %i
        echo %LIST%

    in that it will NOT build up a list of files in the current directory,
    but instead will just set the LIST variable to the last file found.
    Again, this is because the %LIST% is expanded just once when the
    FOR statement is read, and at that time the LIST variable is empty.
    So the actual FOR loop we are executing is:

        for %i in (*) do set LIST= %i

    which just keeps setting LIST to the last file found.

    Delayed environment variable expansion allows you to use a different
    character (the exclamation mark) to expand environment variables at
    execution time.  If delayed variable expansion is enabled, the above
    examples could be written as follows to work as intended:

        set VAR=before
        if &#34;%VAR%&#34; == &#34;before&#34; (
            set VAR=after
            if &#34;!VAR!&#34; == &#34;after&#34; @echo If you see this, it worked
        )

        set LIST=
        for %i in (*) do set LIST=!LIST! %i
        echo %LIST%

    If Command Extensions are enabled, then there are several dynamic
    environment variables that can be expanded but which don&#39;t show up in
    the list of variables displayed by SET.  These variable values are
    computed dynamically each time the value of the variable is expanded.
    If the user explicitly defines a variable with one of these names, then
    that definition will override the dynamic one described below:

    %CD% - expands to the current directory string.

    %DATE% - expands to current date using same format as DATE command.

    %TIME% - expands to current time using same format as TIME command.

    %RANDOM% - expands to a random decimal number between 0 and 32767.

    %ERRORLEVEL% - expands to the current ERRORLEVEL value

    %CMDEXTVERSION% - expands to the current Command Processor Extensions
        version number.

    %CMDCMDLINE% - expands to the original command line that invoked the
        Command Processor.

    %HIGHESTNUMANODENUMBER% - expands to the highest NUMA node number
        on this machine.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class SETLOCAL:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Begins localization of environment changes in a batch file.  Environment
    changes made after SETLOCAL has been issued are local to the batch file.
    ENDLOCAL must be issued to restore the previous settings.  When the end
    of a batch script is reached, an implied ENDLOCAL is executed for any
    outstanding SETLOCAL commands issued by that batch script.

    SETLOCAL

    If Command Extensions are enabled SETLOCAL changes as follows:

    SETLOCAL batch command now accepts optional arguments:
            ENABLEEXTENSIONS / DISABLEEXTENSIONS
                enable or disable command processor extensions. These
                arguments takes precedence over the CMD /E:ON or /E:OFF
                switches. See CMD /? for details.
            ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION / DISABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
                enable or disable delayed environment variable
                expansion. These arguments takes precedence over the CMD
                /V:ON or /V:OFF switches. See CMD /? for details.
    These modifications last until the matching ENDLOCAL command,
    regardless of their setting prior to the SETLOCAL command.

    The SETLOCAL command will set the ERRORLEVEL value if given
    an argument.  It will be zero if one of the two valid arguments
    is given and one otherwise.  You can use this in batch scripts
    to determine if the extensions are available, using the following
    technique:

        VERIFY OTHER 2&gt;nul
        SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS
        IF ERRORLEVEL 1 echo Unable to enable extensions

    This works because on old versions of CMD.EXE, SETLOCAL does NOT
    set the ERRORLEVEL value. The VERIFY command with a bad argument
    initializes the ERRORLEVEL value to a non-zero value.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class ENDLOCAL:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Ends localization of environment changes in a batch file.
    Environment changes made after ENDLOCAL has been issued are
    not local to the batch file; the previous settings are not
    restored on termination of the batch file.

    ENDLOCAL

    If Command Extensions are enabled ENDLOCAL changes as follows:

    If the corresponding SETLOCAL enable or disabled command extensions
    using the new ENABLEEXTENSIONS or DISABLEEXTENSIONS options, then
    after the ENDLOCAL, the enabled/disabled state of command extensions
    will be restored to what it was prior to the matching SETLOCAL
    command execution.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class GOTO:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Directs cmd.exe to a labeled line in a batch program.

    GOTO label

      label   Specifies a text string used in the batch program as a label.

    You type a label on a line by itself, beginning with a colon.

    If Command Extensions are enabled GOTO changes as follows:

    GOTO command now accepts a target label of :EOF which transfers control
    to the end of the current batch script file.  This is an easy way to
    exit a batch script file without defining a label.  Type CALL /?  for a
    description of extensions to the CALL command that make this feature
    useful.

    Executing GOTO :EOF after a CALL with a target label will return control
    to the statement immediately following the CALL.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class EXIT:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Quits the CMD.EXE program (command interpreter) or the current batch
    script.

    EXIT [/B] [exitCode]

      /B          specifies to exit the current batch script instead of
                  CMD.EXE.  If executed from outside a batch script, it
                  will quit CMD.EXE

      exitCode    specifies a numeric number.  if /B is specified, sets
                  ERRORLEVEL that number.  If quitting CMD.EXE, sets the process
                  exit code with that number.

    If Command Extensions are enabled EXIT changes as follows:

    Executing EXIT /B after a CALL with a target label will return control
    to the statement immediately following the CALL.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;


@_help
class CHDIR:
    r&#34;&#34;&#34;
    Displays the name of or changes the current directory.

    CHDIR [/D] [drive:][path]
    CHDIR [..]
    CD [/D] [drive:][path]
    CD [..]

      ..   Specifies that you want to change to the parent directory.

    Type CD drive: to display the current directory in the specified drive.
    Type CD without parameters to display the current drive and directory.

    Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current
    directory for a drive.

    If Command Extensions are enabled CHDIR changes as follows:

    The current directory string is converted to use the same case as
    the on disk names.  So CD C:\TEMP would actually set the current
    directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on disk.

    CHDIR command does not treat spaces as delimiters, so it is possible to
    CD into a subdirectory name that contains a space without surrounding
    the name with quotes.  For example:

        cd \winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu

    is the same as:

        cd &#34;\winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu&#34;

    which is what you would have to type if extensions were disabled.

    PUSHD [path | ..]

    path        Specifies the directory to make the current directory.

    If Command Extensions are enabled the PUSHD command accepts
    network paths in addition to the normal drive letter and path.
    If a network path is specified, PUSHD will create a temporary
    drive letter that points to that specified network resource and
    then change the current drive and directory, using the newly
    defined drive letter.  Temporary drive letters are allocated from
    Z: on down, using the first unused drive letter found.

      names         Specifies a list of one or more files or directories.
                    Wildcards may be used to delete multiple files. If a
                    directory is specified, all files within the directory
                    will be deleted.

      /P            Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.
      /F            Force deleting of read-only files.
      /S            Delete specified files from all subdirectories.
      /Q            Quiet mode, do not ask if ok to delete on global wildcard
      /A            Selects files to delete based on attributes

                    O  Offline files              -  Prefix meaning not

    If Command Extensions are enabled DEL and ERASE change as follows:

    The display semantics of the /S switch are reversed in that it shows
    you only the files that are deleted, not the ones it could not find.

@_help
class FOR:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Runs a specified command for each file in a set of files.

    FOR %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]

      %variable  Specifies a single letter replaceable parameter.
      (set)      Specifies a set of one or more files.  Wildcards may be used.
      command    Specifies the command to carry out for each file.
      command-parameters
                 Specifies parameters or switches for the specified command.

    To use the FOR command in a batch program, specify %%variable instead
    of %variable.  Variable names are case sensitive, so %i is different
    from %I.

    If Command Extensions are enabled, the following additional
    forms of the FOR command are supported:

    FOR /D %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]

        If set contains wildcards, then specifies to match against directory
        names instead of file names.

    FOR /R [[drive:]path] %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]

        Walks the directory tree rooted at [drive:]path, executing the FOR
        statement in each directory of the tree.  If no directory
        specification is specified after /R then the current directory is
        assumed.  If set is just a single period (.) character then it
        will just enumerate the directory tree.

    FOR /L %variable IN (start,step,end) DO command [command-parameters]

        The set is a sequence of numbers from start to end, by step amount.
        So (1,1,5) would generate the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 and (5,-1,1) would
        generate the sequence (5 4 3 2 1)

    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (&#34;string&#34;) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (&#39;command&#39;) DO command [command-parameters]

        or, if usebackq option present:

    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (&#39;string&#39;) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F [&#34;options&#34;] %variable IN (`command`) DO command [command-parameters]

        file-set is one or more file names.  Each file is opened, read
        and processed before going on to the next file in file-set.
        Processing consists of reading in the file, breaking it up into
        individual lines of text and then parsing each line into zero or
        more tokens.  The body of the for loop is then called with the
        variable value(s) set to the found token string(s).  By default, /F
        passes the first blank separated token from each line of each file.
        Blank lines are skipped.  You can override the default parsing
        behavior by specifying the optional &#34;options&#34; parameter.  This
        is a quoted string which contains one or more keywords to specify
        different parsing options.  The keywords are:

            eol=c           - specifies an end of line comment character
                              (just one)
            skip=n          - specifies the number of lines to skip at the
                              beginning of the file.
            delims=xxx      - specifies a delimiter set.  This replaces the
                              default delimiter set of space and tab.
            tokens=x,y,m-n  - specifies which tokens from each line are to
                              be passed to the for body for each iteration.
                              This will cause additional variable names to
                              be allocated.  The m-n form is a range,
                              specifying the mth through the nth tokens.  If
                              the last character in the tokens= string is an
                              asterisk, then an additional variable is
                              allocated and receives the remaining text on
                              the line after the last token parsed.
            usebackq        - specifies that the new semantics are in force,
                              where a back quoted string is executed as a
                              command and a single quoted string is a
                              literal string command and allows the use of
                              double quotes to quote file names in
                              file-set.

        Some examples might help:

    FOR /F &#34;eol=; tokens=2,3* delims=, &#34; %i in (myfile.txt) do @echo %i %j %k

        would parse each line in myfile.txt, ignoring lines that begin with
        a semicolon, passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for
        body, with tokens delimited by commas and/or spaces.  Notice the for
        body statements reference %i to get the 2nd token, %j to get the
        3rd token, and %k to get all remaining tokens after the 3rd.  For
        file names that contain spaces, you need to quote the filenames with
        double quotes.  In order to use double quotes in this manner, you also
        need to use the usebackq option, otherwise the double quotes will be
        interpreted as defining a literal string to parse.

        %i is explicitly declared in the for statement and the %j and %k
        are implicitly declared via the tokens= option.  You can specify up
        to 26 tokens via the tokens= line, provided it does not cause an
        attempt to declare a variable higher than the letter &#39;z&#39; or &#39;Z&#39;.
        Remember, FOR variables are single-letter, case sensitive, global,
        and you can&#39;t have more than 52 total active at any one time.

        You can also use the FOR /F parsing logic on an immediate string, by
        making the file-set between the parenthesis a quoted string,
        using single quote characters.  It will be treated as a single line
        of input from a file and parsed.

        Finally, you can use the FOR /F command to parse the output of a
        command.  You do this by making the file-set between the
        parenthesis a back quoted string.  It will be treated as a command
        line, which is passed to a child CMD.EXE and the output is captured
        into memory and parsed as if it was a file.  So the following
        example:

          FOR /F &#34;usebackq delims==&#34; %i IN (`set`) DO @echo %i

        would enumerate the environment variable names in the current
        environment.

    In addition, substitution of FOR variable references has been enhanced.
    You can now use the following optional syntax:

        %~I         - expands %I removing any surrounding quotes (&#34;)
        %~fI        - expands %I to a fully qualified path name
        %~dI        - expands %I to a drive letter only
        %~pI        - expands %I to a path only
        %~nI        - expands %I to a file name only
        %~xI        - expands %I to a file extension only
        %~sI        - expanded path contains short names only
        %~aI        - expands %I to file attributes of file
        %~tI        - expands %I to date/time of file
        %~zI        - expands %I to size of file
        %~$PATH:I   - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                       environment variable and expands %I to the
                       fully qualified name of the first one found.
                       If the environment variable name is not
                       defined or the file is not found by the
                       search, then this modifier expands to the
                       empty string

    The modifiers can be combined to get compound results:

        %~dpI       - expands %I to a drive letter and path only
        %~nxI       - expands %I to a file name and extension only
        %~fsI       - expands %I to a full path name with short names only
        %~dp$PATH:I - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                       environment variable for %I and expands to the
                       drive letter and path of the first one found.
        %~ftzaI     - expands %I to a DIR like output line

    In the above examples %I and PATH can be replaced by other valid
    values.  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid FOR variable name.
    Picking upper case variable names like %I makes it more readable and
    avoids confusion with the modifiers, which are not case sensitive.

@_help
class IF:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Performs conditional processing in batch programs.

    IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command
    IF [NOT] string1==string2 command
    IF [NOT] EXIST filename command

      NOT               Specifies that Windows should carry out
                        the command only if the condition is false.

      ERRORLEVEL number Specifies a true condition if the last program run
                        returned an exit code equal to or greater than the number
                        specified.

      string1==string2  Specifies a true condition if the specified text strings
                        match.

      EXIST filename    Specifies a true condition if the specified filename
                        exists.

      command           Specifies the command to carry out if the condition is
                        met.  Command can be followed by ELSE command which
                        will execute the command after the ELSE keyword if the
                        specified condition is FALSE

    The ELSE clause must occur on the same line as the command after the IF.  For
    example:

        IF EXIST filename. (
            del filename.
        ) ELSE (
            echo filename. missing.
        )

    The following would NOT work because the del command needs to be terminated
    by a newline:

        IF EXIST filename. del filename. ELSE echo filename. missing

    Nor would the following work, since the ELSE command must be on the same line
    as the end of the IF command:

        IF EXIST filename. del filename.
        ELSE echo filename. missing

    The following would work if you want it all on one line:

        IF EXIST filename. (del filename.) ELSE echo filename. missing

    If Command Extensions are enabled IF changes as follows:

        IF [/I] string1 compare-op string2 command
        IF CMDEXTVERSION number command
        IF DEFINED variable command

    where compare-op may be one of:

        EQU - equal
        NEQ - not equal
        LSS - less than
        LEQ - less than or equal
        GTR - greater than
        GEQ - greater than or equal

    and the /I switch, if specified, says to do case insensitive string
    compares.  The /I switch can also be used on the string1==string2 form
    of IF.  These comparisons are generic, in that if both string1 and
    string2 are both comprised of all numeric digits, then the strings are
    converted to numbers and a numeric comparison is performed.

    The CMDEXTVERSION conditional works just like ERRORLEVEL, except it is
    comparing against an internal version number associated with the Command
    Extensions.  The first version is 1.  It will be incremented by one when
    significant enhancements are added to the Command Extensions.
    CMDEXTVERSION conditional is never true when Command Extensions are
    disabled.

    The DEFINED conditional works just like EXIST except it takes an
    environment variable name and returns true if the environment variable
    is defined.

    %ERRORLEVEL% will expand into a string representation of
    the current value of ERRORLEVEL, provided that there is not already
    an environment variable with the name ERRORLEVEL, in which case you
    will get its value instead.  After running a program, the following
    illustrates ERRORLEVEL use:

        goto answer%ERRORLEVEL%
        :answer0
        echo Program had return code 0
        :answer1
        echo Program had return code 1

    You can also use numerical comparisons above:

        IF %ERRORLEVEL% LEQ 1 goto okay

    %CMDCMDLINE% will expand into the original command line passed to
    CMD.EXE prior to any processing by CMD.EXE, provided that there is not
    already an environment variable with the name CMDCMDLINE, in which case
    you will get its value instead.

    %CMDEXTVERSION% will expand into a string representation of the
    current value of CMDEXTVERSION, provided that there is not already
    an environment variable with the name CMDEXTVERSION, in which case you
    will get its value instead.

        command/program
                    If it is an internal cmd command or a batch file then
                    the command processor is run with the /K switch to cmd.exe.
                    This means that the window will remain after the command
                    has been run.

                    If it is not an internal cmd command or batch file then
                    it is a program and will run as either a windowed application
                    or a console application.

        parameters  These are the parameters passed to the command/program.

    NOTE: The SEPARATE and SHARED options are not supported on 64-bit platforms.

    Specifying /NODE allows processes to be created in a way that leverages memory
    locality on NUMA systems.  For example, two processes that communicate with
    each other heavily through shared memory can be created to share the same
    preferred NUMA node in order to minimize memory latencies.  They allocate
    memory from the same NUMA node when possible, and they are free to run on
    processors outside the specified node.

        start /NODE 1 application1.exe
        start /NODE 1 application2.exe

    These two processes can be further constrained to run on specific processors
    within the same NUMA node.  In the following example, application1 runs on the
    low-order two processors of the node, while application2 runs on the next two
    processors of the node.  This example assumes the specified node has at least
    four logical processors.  Note that the node number can be changed to any valid
    node number for that computer without having to change the affinity mask.

        start /NODE 1 /AFFINITY 0x3 application1.exe
        start /NODE 1 /AFFINITY 0xc application2.exe

    If Command Extensions are enabled, external command invocation
    through the command line or the START command changes as follows:

    non-executable files may be invoked through their file association just
        by typing the name of the file as a command.  (e.g.  WORD.DOC would
        launch the application associated with the .DOC file extension).
        See the ASSOC and FTYPE commands for how to create these
        associations from within a command script.

    When executing an application that is a 32-bit GUI application, CMD.EXE
        does not wait for the application to terminate before returning to
        the command prompt.  This new behavior does NOT occur if executing
        within a command script.

    When executing a command line whose first token is the string &#34;CMD &#34;
        without an extension or path qualifier, then &#34;CMD&#34; is replaced with
        the value of the COMSPEC variable.  This prevents picking up CMD.EXE
        from the current directory.

    When executing a command line whose first token does NOT contain an
        extension, then CMD.EXE uses the value of the PATHEXT
        environment variable to determine which extensions to look for
        and in what order.  The default value for the PATHEXT variable
        is:

            .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD

        Notice the syntax is the same as the PATH variable, with
        semicolons separating the different elements.

    When searching for an executable, if there is no match on any extension,
    then looks to see if the name matches a directory name.  If it does, the
    START command launches the Explorer on that path.  If done from the
    command line, it is the equivalent to doing a CD /D to that path.

@_help
class CMD:
    R&#34;&#34;&#34;
    Starts a new instance of the Windows command interpreter

    CMD [/A | /U] [/Q] [/D] [/E:ON | /E:OFF] [/F:ON | /F:OFF] [/V:ON | /V:OFF]
        [[/S] [/C | /K] string]

    /C      Carries out the command specified by string and then terminates
    /K      Carries out the command specified by string but remains
    /S      Modifies the treatment of string after /C or /K (see below)
    /Q      Turns echo off
    /D      Disable execution of AutoRun commands from registry (see below)
    /A      Causes the output of internal commands to a pipe or file to be ANSI
    /U      Causes the output of internal commands to a pipe or file to be
            Unicode
    /T:fg   Sets the foreground/background colors (see COLOR /? for more info)
    /E:ON   Enable command extensions (see below)
    /E:OFF  Disable command extensions (see below)
    /F:ON   Enable file and directory name completion characters (see below)
    /F:OFF  Disable file and directory name completion characters (see below)
    /V:ON   Enable delayed environment variable expansion using ! as the
            delimiter. For example, /V:ON would allow !var! to expand the
            variable var at execution time.  The var syntax expands variables
            at input time, which is quite a different thing when inside of a FOR
            loop.
    /V:OFF  Disable delayed environment expansion.

    Note that multiple commands separated by the command separator &#39;&amp;&amp;&#39;
    are accepted for string if surrounded by quotes.  Also, for compatibility
    reasons, /X is the same as /E:ON, /Y is the same as /E:OFF and /R is the
    same as /C.  Any other switches are ignored.

    If /C or /K is specified, then the remainder of the command line after
    the switch is processed as a command line, where the following logic is
    used to process quote (&#34;) characters:

        1.  If all of the following conditions are met, then quote characters
            on the command line are preserved:

            - no /S switch
            - exactly two quote characters
            - no special characters between the two quote characters,
              where special is one of: &amp;&lt;&gt;()@^|
            - there are one or more whitespace characters between the
              two quote characters
            - the string between the two quote characters is the name
              of an executable file.

        2.  Otherwise, old behavior is to see if the first character is
            a quote character and if so, strip the leading character and
            remove the last quote character on the command line, preserving
            any text after the last quote character.

    If /D was NOT specified on the command line, then when CMD.EXE starts, it
    looks for the following REG_SZ/REG_EXPAND_SZ registry variables, and if
    either or both are present, they are executed first.

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun

            and/or

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun

    Command Extensions are enabled by default.  You may also disable
    extensions for a particular invocation by using the /E:OFF switch.  You
    can enable or disable extensions for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a
    machine and/or user logon session by setting either or both of the
    following REG_DWORD values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\EnableExtensions

            and/or

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\EnableExtensions

    to either 0x1 or 0x0.  The user specific setting takes precedence over
    the machine setting.  The command line switches take precedence over the
    registry settings.

    In a batch file, the SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS or DISABLEEXTENSIONS arguments
    takes precedence over the /E:ON or /E:OFF switch. See SETLOCAL /? for details.

    The command extensions involve changes and/or additions to the following
    commands:

        DEL or ERASE
        COLOR
        CD or CHDIR
        MD or MKDIR
        PROMPT
        PUSHD
        POPD
        SET
        SETLOCAL
        ENDLOCAL
        IF
        FOR
        CALL
        SHIFT
        GOTO
        START (also includes changes to external command invocation)
        ASSOC
        FTYPE

    To get specific details, type commandname /? to view the specifics.

    Delayed environment variable expansion is NOT enabled by default.  You
    can enable or disable delayed environment variable expansion for a
    particular invocation of CMD.EXE with the /V:ON or /V:OFF switch.  You
    can enable or disable delayed expansion for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a
    machine and/or user logon session by setting either or both of the
    following REG_DWORD values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion

            and/or

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion

    to either 0x1 or 0x0.  The user specific setting takes precedence over
    the machine setting.  The command line switches take precedence over the
    registry settings.

    In a batch file the SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION or DISABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
    arguments takes precedence over the /V:ON or /V:OFF switch. See SETLOCAL /?
    for details.

    If delayed environment variable expansion is enabled, then the exclamation
    character can be used to substitute the value of an environment variable
    at execution time.

    You can enable or disable file name completion for a particular
    invocation of CMD.EXE with the /F:ON or /F:OFF switch.  You can enable
    or disable completion for all invocations of CMD.EXE on a machine and/or
    user logon session by setting either or both of the following REG_DWORD
    values in the registry using REGEDIT.EXE:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\CompletionChar
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\PathCompletionChar

            and/or

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\CompletionChar
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\PathCompletionChar

    with the hex value of a control character to use for a particular
    function (e.g.  0x4 is Ctrl-D and 0x6 is Ctrl-F).  The user specific
    settings take precedence over the machine settings.  The command line
    switches take precedence over the registry settings.

    If completion is enabled with the /F:ON switch, the two control
    characters used are Ctrl-D for directory name completion and Ctrl-F for
    file name completion.  To disable a particular completion character in
    the registry, use the value for space (0x20) as it is not a valid
    control character.

    Completion is invoked when you type either of the two control
    characters.  The completion function takes the path string to the left
    of the cursor appends a wild card character to it if none is already
    present and builds up a list of paths that match.  It then displays the
    first matching path.  If no paths match, it just beeps and leaves the
    display alone.  Thereafter, repeated pressing of the same control
    character will cycle through the list of matching paths.  Pressing the
    Shift key with the control character will move through the list
    backwards.  If you edit the line in any way and press the control
    character again, the saved list of matching paths is discarded and a new
    one generated.  The same occurs if you switch between file and directory
    name completion.  The only difference between the two control characters
    is the file completion character matches both file and directory names,
    while the directory completion character only matches directory names.
    If file completion is used on any of the built in directory commands
    (CD, MD or RD) then directory completion is assumed.

    The completion code deals correctly with file names that contain spaces
    or other special characters by placing quotes around the matching path.
    Also, if you back up, then invoke completion from within a line, the
    text to the right of the cursor at the point completion was invoked is
    discarded.

    The special characters that require quotes are:
         &lt;space&gt;
         &amp;()[]{}^=;!&#39;+,`~
